- This repo is the Rails API on which the React frontend (https://github.com/garrengotthardt/break-5-client) of the app is built
- Break5 leverages the Google Places API and a multi-level parser built with Nokogiri to take a user-entered address, gather menu information from nearby establishments, and parse it to provide the user with items under $5
